## 2026-08-17: Phase 1 Start — FastAPI Backend Scaffold

**What:** Created minimal FastAPI backend with `/generate` endpoint.

**Implementation:**
- `backend/app/main.py`: FastAPI app with CORS middleware, health check endpoint, and `/generate` POST endpoint
- Request model accepts a `prompt` string
- Response model returns a `message` and `files` dict
- Stub implementation returns hardcoded HTML/CSS files — no LLM call yet
- Added docstrings to explain each component's role in the future pipeline (Planner/Coder/Sandbox/Debugger)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Used Pydantic models for request/response validation — explicit contracts make it easier to evolve the API
- CORS configured to allow localhost:3000 (Next.js dev server) — will need to be configurable via env var for production
- Returned dict of files rather than array — makes it easier to reference files by name in later phases

**Testing:**
- Manual curl tests verified both health check and `/generate` endpoints work
- Server starts successfully with `uvicorn app.main:app`

**Next:** Wire this endpoint to a Next.js frontend (Task 2).
